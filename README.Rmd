```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Installation

The package is located on GitHub. You should install it with the `devtools` library using the following lines of code.


```{r eval=FALSE}
# install 'devtools'
install.packages("devtools")

# import 'devtools'
library(devtools)

# install 'goyav' from github
install_github("AntoninVidon/goyav")
```

```{r}
# import 'goyav'
library(goyav)
```

You may have to upgrade some of your packages in order to successfully install `goyav`.

## The `goyav` package

### Description

`goyav` is a shiny App meant to generate GIF from tabular temporal data. All customization of the animated plots is done in an interactive window.

The dashboard of the application looks like this :

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("README/dashboard.PNG")
```

The user is able to navigate into two tabs : "Animate" and "Advanced animate", the latter offering a wider range of customization.

From the *Animate* tab, you may choose the following :

- X variable (numeric);
- Y variable (numeric);
- size variable (numeric);
- color variable (factor);
- temporal variable (numeric);
- choose if you want to apply a log-scale to either X, Y or X and Y.

From the *Advanced animated* tab, you may choose the following :

- X variable (numeric);
- Y variable (numeric);
- size variable (numeric);
- color variable (factor);
- temporal variable (numeric);
- choose if you want to apply a log-scale to either X, Y or X and Y.
- X range;
- Y range;
- Temporal range;
- Animation duration (s);
- Factors to include (for the color variable).



### Demonstration

In order to better show the use of the package, we will import and use the `gapminder` dataset from the `gapminder` package.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# install `gapminder`
install.packages("gapminder")
```

```{r}
# load `gapminder`
library(gapminder)

# display first rows of dataset
knitr::kable(head(gapminder))
```

In order to be able to create any GIF, your dataframe should have candidate columns for the following variables: X, Y, size and temporal. Therefore, *calling the `goyav` function on a dataframe with less than 4 numeric variables will return an error*.

```{r, error=TRUE}
# try to call the `goyav` function on the first 3 columns of the `gapminder` dataset
goyav(gapminder[,1:3])
```

Let's now call `goyav` on the whole dataset :

```{r eval=FALSE}
# call `goyav` on `gapminder`
goyav(gapminder)
```

#### View from the *Animate* tab

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("README/Animate.gif")
```

#### View from the *Advanced animate* tab

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("README/AdvancedAnimate.gif")
```
